## Getting Started
1. Fork and clone this repo.

1. Run the command "npm install"

1. Create a database titled grounded.

1. Start the build process and your application with: npm run start:dev. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute npm run start-server and npm run build:watch separately (in their own terminal tabs).

1. Navigate to localhost:8080 to see the site in the browser.

1. Check out the starting seed file in seed.js - you can run it by executing npm run seed. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
